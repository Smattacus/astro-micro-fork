Hello world!

I am Sean Mattingly, a Physical Design Methodology Engineer (as of 2024) at Intel. Outside of that job, I read a lot of technical books on various subjects as 
well as learn new technical skills. A lot of these books I apply to my daily work!

My education is in plasma physics, with a PhD in plasma physics from the University of Iowa. Here's a (much) younger me in the laboratory - second from left!:
